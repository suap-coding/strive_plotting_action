# strive_plotting_action

Main stuff u can find in main_stuff.ipynb :]

I'm going to pull more numerical data and start plotting.
For now we can download over 6000 rows of info about movies with:
. movie name
. rating
. release date
. runtime (length of the movie in minutes)
. genre

I'd like to get filming times, would be a nice addition to current data.
